Turn Based Battler Game
<br>
This is a project sample of a turn based game similar to games like the Kiseki series or Pokemon.
<br>
One thing that I wanted to add to this was the ability to target specific body parts like in Vagrant Story.
Each body part could have different strengths and weaknesses, and as body parts get crippled, the battle will unfold in different ways.
<br>
I want the damage in the game to be rather deterministic so that you can see a weapons damage and character's power level to have a good idea of
how much damage will be dealt without taking into account weaknesses or resistances.
### Future TODOs
Something I would love to add to this project is to make the game a rouge-lite where each run you start off with different stats and weapon.
This could then create replayability as you want to see how far you can get on different runs.
